This library is currently missing support for quite some features, including:

-authentication types other than MD5
-SSL encrypted sessions
-multiple SQL commands per query
-some data types like date/time, bytea, ...
-prepared statements
-canceling commands/queries
-bulk copy

This library is (at least currently) not thread-safe,
so for every goroutine that must talk to the same database,
a separate Conn is required.
