About go-pgsql
==============

go-pgsql is a PostgreSQL client library for the Go programming language.

It partially implements version 3.0 of the PostgreSQL frontend/backend protocol,
so it should work with servers of version 7.4 and later.

Installing go-pgsql
===================

1. Make sure you have a working Go installation, see the installation guide at
   http://golang.org/doc/install.html
2. git clone git://github.com/lxn/go-pgsql.git
3. cd go-pgsql && make install

Alternatively you can use goinstall:
goinstall github.com/lxn/go-pgsql

Using go-pgsql
==============

At present there are no examples but you can find some tests in pgsql_test.go,
which should get you started.

This is a young project so there will be bugs for sure.
Please open an issue on the bug tracker if you encounter one of them.

Missing Features
================

go-pgsql is currently missing support for some features, including:

- authentication types other than MD5
- SSL encrypted sessions
- some data types like date/time, bytea, ...
- canceling commands/queries
- bulk copy
...

go-pgsql is (at least for now) not thread-safe, so for every goroutine
that must talk to the same database, a separate Conn is required.
